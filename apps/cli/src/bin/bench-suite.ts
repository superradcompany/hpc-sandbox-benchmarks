//
// `--replicates <indices>` drives the WHOLE between-machine fan-out for this (provider, suite) cell

// runner-per-replicate matrix billed R idle runners to do one runner's work (see ../lib/replicates.ts).
// Every replicate is run to completion regardless of its peers' outcomes and its shard is written
// either way, so one flaky sandbox can't discard the rest of the fleet's results.

usage: bench-suite [provider] [suite] [runId]
       bench-suite [--help] [--list-providers] [--list-suites] [--json]

  provider                Provider to run on (default: daytona-vm). See --list-providers.
  suite                   Suite to run (default: cpu-node). See --list-suites.
  runId                   Run identifier for the data/ tree (default: local-<timestamp>).
  --replicates <indices>  Drive the whole replicate fan-out from THIS process: a JSON array
                          ("[0,1,2]", what plan-replicates emits) or a comma-separated list ("0,1,2").
                          Each index gets its own sandbox, raw tree (data/raw/<runId>/r<idx>/) and
                          shard (data/runs/<runId>-r<idx>.json); they run concurrently and every one
                          is run to completion even if a peer fails. This is the CI matrix's form.
  --max-concurrency <n>   Cap the replicate sandboxes in flight (default: all at once). Also read from
                          BENCH_MAX_CONCURRENCY. Lower it when a provider's quota makes a wide fan-out
                          spend its create-retry budget queueing. A cap runs the fleet in ceil(R / n)
                          serial waves; under CI (BENCH_CELL_BUDGET_MINUTES) a cap whose waves cannot
                          fit the job budget is rejected up front rather than cancelled mid-fan-out.
  --replicate <idx>       Run ONE replicate (a non-negative integer), stamped onto the shard Run so
                          the aggregate folds ≥2 replicates of one suite together. Writes the
                          un-suffixed data/runs/<runId>.json — the single-sandbox/local form.
  --require <ids>         Comma-separated providers that MUST reach "validated"; exit 1 otherwise.
                          Also read from REQUIRE_PROVIDERS. CI sets this so a missing secret fails loudly.
  --list-providers        List the registered providers.
  --list-suites           List the registered suites and their dimensions/metrics.
  --json                  Emit --list-* output as JSON instead of human-readable lines.
  --help, -h              Show this help.

Missing provider credentials are recorded as a skip (the provider stays "pending"), so this is
runnable without secrets. Writes the shard Run(s) under data/runs/ and updates data/runs/index.json.

examples:
  bench-suite daytona-vm cpu-node                 # one suite locally, auto runId
  bench-suite modal-vm memory ci-1234             # a specific cell + runId
  bench-suite e2b memory --require e2b            # fail (don't skip) if E2B_API_KEY is absent
  bench-suite e2b memory ci-1 --replicates 0,1,2  # 3 replicate sandboxes from this one process
  bench-suite --list-suites                       # discover the suite names first

Next: render the Run with \`leaderboard data/runs/<runId>.json\`.`;
