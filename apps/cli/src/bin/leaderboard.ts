usage: leaderboard <run.json> [outFile.md]
       leaderboard [--help] [--list-providers] [--list-suites] [--json]

  <run.json>         Path to a normalized Run document (required).
  [outFile.md]       Write the Markdown here; omit to print to stdout.
  --list-providers   List the registered providers.
  --list-suites      List the registered suites.
  --json             Emit --list-* output as JSON instead of human-readable lines.
  --help, -h         Show this help.

examples:
  leaderboard data/runs/local-1.json                 # print the table to stdout
  leaderboard data/runs/local-1.json LEADERBOARD.md  # write the comparison surface to a file
