// `plan-replicates` — emit the per-suite replicate index arrays as a SINGLE LINE of compact JSON object,
// e.g. `{"cpu-node":[0,1,2],"realworld-mastra":[0,1,2,3,4]}`. This is a $GITHUB_OUTPUT contract the Bench
// matrix reads: the suite-matrix job passes each suite its own slice
// (`fromJSON(needs.plan.outputs.replicates)[matrix.suite]`) to the reusable bench-suite.yml, which hands
// it to `bench-suite --replicates` — so N replicate sandboxes run per (provider, suite) cell, all driven
// concurrently by that cell's single runner. This is the BETWEEN-MACHINE axis that captures a provider's
// fleet variation (two sandboxes can land on different host hardware).
//
// The count per suite is its schema-declared Suite.defaultReplicas, overridable for the whole run by the
// BENCH_REPLICAS dispatch input (blank = each suite's default; a number scales every suite). The suite
// KEYS match plan-suites' selection exactly (both parse BENCH_SUITES via selectSuites), so the map covers
// precisely the suites the suite axis emits and never desynchronizes from it.
//
// In Actions ($GITHUB_OUTPUT set) the bin writes `replicates=` via emitStepOutputs and logs through
// @actions/core — no bash capture that could splice diagnostics into the outputs file. Mirrors
// plan-providers / plan-suites; the replicate map is an object (not a string[]) so it emits directly
// rather than through the shared string-axis runner in plan-axis.ts.

usage: plan-replicates [--help] [--list-providers] [--list-suites] [--json]

  (no args)          Print {"cpu-node":[0,1,2], …} on a single line (local), or write replicates= to
                     $GITHUB_OUTPUT when set (the Bench matrix plan step). Each suite maps to [0..R-1].
  --list-providers   List the registered providers each replicate cell runs on.
  --list-suites      List the registered suites and their dimensions/metrics.
  --json             Emit --list-* output as JSON instead of human-readable lines.
  --help, -h         Show this help.

environment:
  BENCH_SUITES       Comma-separated suites to plan replicates for (same selection as plan-suites). Unset
                     or blank selects every registered suite. An unregistered name is an error.
  BENCH_REPLICAS     Replicate sandboxes per (provider, suite) cell. Unset or blank keeps each suite's
                     schema default (Suite.defaultReplicas); a positive integer overrides every suite —
                     higher for tighter between-machine intervals, 1 for a quick single-sandbox pass. A
                     non-positive or non-integer value is an error, never a silently empty fan-out.
  GITHUB_OUTPUT      When set (Actions), write replicates= step output instead of printing on stdout.

examples:
  plan-replicates                              # local: each suite at its schema default replicate count
  BENCH_REPLICAS=5 plan-replicates             # every suite fanned out to 5 replicate sandboxes
  BENCH_SUITES=network BENCH_REPLICAS=1 plan-replicates   # a single network sandbox (a quick pass)

Next: drive a suite's whole fleet with  bench-suite <provider> <suite> <runId> --replicates <indices>`;
