// `release-ensure-public` — the script behind the `ensure-package-public` composite action. Fails fast
// (with rich @actions/core annotations) if a candidate package is not public. e2b builds its template
// on E2B's REMOTE builder (FROM the ghcr candidate base), daytona/modal/novita pull it to snapshot/boot,
// and the vercel bake cell pulls it to mirror into VCR — none are handed ghcr pull credentials, so every
// candidate package MUST be public. GHCR packages are created PRIVATE on first push with no API to flip
// visibility, so making one public is a one-time manual bootstrap; this guard surfaces that plainly
// instead of an opaque provider pull error.
//
// `PACKAGE` is a comma-separated list (the plan emits every anonymously-pulled package, which today is
// just the shared base — every provider derives from it, so adding a provider adds no package). EVERY
// name is checked before the gate reports, so one run tells the operator about all the packages needing
// the bootstrap rather than one per re-dispatch.
//
// Inputs arrive as env (the composite maps its `with:` inputs). Uses Bun's fetch + a real JSON parse
// (not a curl+grep), and core.setFailed/warning so the outcome renders as a run annotation.
