# Declarative provider onboarding

## Context

Adding one benchmarked provider currently touches 25–34 files. Measured over the last four
additions:

| Commit | Files changed |
|---|---|
| `4ee64f2` Microsandbox local + cloud | 25 |
| `6da0dce` Vercel Sandbox | 25 |
| `22f36c4` run.cloud | 34 |
| `36a802a` Runloop | 34 |

**Eighteen** of those files were touched by *all four*. That set is the boilerplate spine — it is
not where the provider-specific work lives:

```text
packages/schema/src/providers.ts            packages/schema/src/providers.test.ts
packages/providers/src/lib/adapters.ts      packages/providers/src/index.test.ts
packages/providers/package.json             package.json + bun.lock
apps/cli/src/lib/providers-run.test.ts      apps/cli/src/lib/bake/validate.ts(.test.ts)
apps/cli/src/lib/bake/promote.ts            apps/cli/src/bin/release-plan.ts(.test.ts)
apps/cli/src/bin/bake.ts                    .github/workflows/toolchain-image.yml
.github/workflows/bench-suite.yml           .github/workflows/bench-smoke.yml
.env.example
```

The genuinely novel work — the adapter (`runcloud.ts` is 576 lines, `microsandbox.ts` 630) and its
bake module — is 2–4 files. Everything else re-spells the same fact in a new dialect.

### What already works

The **runtime** path is fully registry-driven. `PROVIDERS` already feeds matrix fan-out
(`apps/cli/src/lib/matrix.ts:57`), normalization (`results/src/lib/normalize-tree.ts:52`), figures
(`results/src/lib/figures.ts:96`), economics (`schema/src/economics.ts:107`), and the skip-vs-fail
credential loop (`apps/cli/src/lib/providers-run.ts`). `packages/harness` has no provider-keyed
logic at all. This ADR does not touch that half.

### Where it hurts

**1. The bake/release layer has no home for "what artifact does this provider boot?"** That one
fact is spread across six exhaustive provider-keyed structures plus four hand-written ref bags:

| Site | Projection of the same fact |
|---|---|
| `providers/src/config.ts:113-148` | candidate/version *names* (12 consts, 2 aliases) |
| `cli/src/bin/bake.ts:32-66` | `bakers` — builder at the **candidate** name |
| `cli/src/lib/bake/promote.ts:295-348` | the same list at the **version** name |
| `cli/src/lib/bake/validate.ts:39-58` | `baseImageUse` — `bakes`/`boots`/`none` |
| `cli/src/lib/bake/validate.ts:61-107` | `candidateCreateOptions` — which create key points at it |
| `cli/src/bin/release-plan.ts:61-89` | `providerArtifact` — the name, for plan display |
| `cli/src/lib/bake/validate.ts:6-23` | `CandidateRefs` — one field per artifact |
| `bake.ts:180-191`, `:232-242`, `:288-296`, `promote.ts:250-260` | four literal bags of the same names |

`bake.ts` and `promote.ts` differ *only* in candidate-vs-version name. `candidateCreateOptions` is
`adapters[id].createOptions` with the name swapped. None of this is independent information. Worse,
**seven of the fourteen `bakers` entries are no-ops** that exist only to satisfy
`Record<ProviderId, …>` — the type is forcing us to write code for providers that bake nothing.

**2. Provider identity is stringly-typed at every process boundary.** Ids leave TypeScript as CSV in
`$GITHUB_OUTPUT`, pass through `fromJSON()` in YAML, and return as `--provider e2b,daytona-vm`
argv. Each crossing re-validates ad hoc, and `plan-axis.ts:24` erases the type outright
(`select: (raw: string | undefined) => string[]`), then round-trips through
`JSON.stringify`/`JSON.parse` *within a single process* (`plan-axis.ts:29,53`) to hand downstream
code back a bare `string[]`.

**3. GitHub Actions can't import TypeScript, so the vocabulary is re-spelled by hand.** Three
near-identical credential blocks — `bench-suite.yml:240-277`, `toolchain-image.yml:511-544`, and
`toolchain-image.yml:720-751` (a third dialect using `contains(fromJSON(…))`) — plus
`bench-smoke.yml`'s choice list and `bench-matrix.yml:64`'s CSV. All are mechanical functions of
`requiredEnvVars`. `workflow-sync.ts:105` already computes `requiredCredentialKeys()` — **the
generator exists inside the checker; it just compares instead of emitting.** The other ~20 CI/doc
sites have no gate, and `setup-privileged-environment.sh:57-62` is already stale (omits
`RUNLOOP_API_KEY` and all three `VERCEL_*`).

**4. The env gatekeeper hand-syncs a schema against a key array.** `providers/src/config.ts:23-44`
declares `envSchema`; `:46-62` repeats every key in `ENV_KEYS`; `:73-76` loops over the array to
build the input. A key added to one and not the other is **silently dropped** — no compile error, no
test. This is a latent bug, not a style issue.

**5. Surfaces that fail silently rather than loudly.**

| Site | Silent failure for a new provider |
|---|---|
| `figures/src/model.ts:105-111` `figureProviderName` | prefix map; a new multi-variant vendor prints its full registry name in charts |
| `figures/src/model.ts:114-137` `isolationFromRuntime` | substring map; a novel VMM yields `undefined` and the chart chip goes **blank** |
| `results/src/lib/leaderboard.ts:646-653` `isolationClass` | order-sensitive `gvisor`→`vm`→`container` sniffing |
| `harness/src/index.ts:404-405` | capacity errors classified by regex; a provider whose wording differs **hard-fails instead of retrying** — `:402` records this happening to runcloud |

**6. Five hardcoded id-list oracles** (`providers.test.ts:24-39`, `providers-run.test.ts:33-48`,
`release-plan.test.ts:66-79`, `validate.test.ts:104-123`, `templates/src/index.test.ts:25`) in two
different sort orders. CONTRIBUTING's own checklist has a step named **"Exhaustive consumers"**
(`CONTRIBUTING.md:60`). That step is the bug.

## Decision

### Where parsing lives: three tiers

ADR-0001 established parse-don't-validate at every external boundary. The question this ADR has to
answer is *which* of the provider seams are boundaries, because the answer is measured, not
aesthetic — and the answer moves, so it has to be re-measured rather than assumed.

Marginal cost of each module, measured sequentially in one process (bun 1.3.11, arktype 2.2.0), on
the post-Tama `main` snapshot immediately preceding this ADR series:

| Module | Marginal cost |
|---|---|
| `arktype` (library import, cold) | 240 ms |
| `schema/src/run.ts` (the Run schema graph) | +317 ms |
| `schema/src/providers.ts` (its own schemas) | +63 ms |
| `schema/src/index.ts` (barrel, on top of the above) | +50 ms |
| `schema/src/toolchain.ts` | 1.8 ms |

**These numbers document an erosion that went undetected — the cautionary tale behind Tier 1.**
`schema/providers` was once a ~6.6 ms identity leaf, and `config.ts:5-7`'s deliberate leaf import
saved ~457 ms over the barrel. The leaf has since gained `import { type } from "arktype"` and,
more expensively, a *value* import of `targetSpecSchema` from `run.ts` — dragging the entire Run
schema graph into provider identity. It now costs ~620 ms against the barrel's ~662 ms; the
optimization is all but gone, its explanatory comment is wrong, and no gate noticed. Import cost
is an architectural property: it erodes silently unless a check owns it.

That changes the reasoning but not the conclusion, and it adds a finding worth acting on
independently of this ADR: **restore a genuinely cheap identity leaf.** The current
`identifiers.ts` is not that leaf: it value-imports arktype to construct `providerIdSchema`, so
exporting it under another subpath would retain the library's cold-start cost. Introduce a pure
`provider-ids.ts` instead:

```ts
export const PROVIDER_IDS = ["e2b", "daytona-vm", /* … */] as const;
export type ProviderId = (typeof PROVIDER_IDS)[number];
```

It has no runtime dependency. A separate `provider-parsers.ts` boundary module imports
`PROVIDER_IDS` and constructs `type.enumerated(...PROVIDER_IDS)` plus the CSV/JSON morphs. Export
both subpaths explicitly, and move `TARGET_SPEC` off the `run.ts` value import. This returns imports
that need only provider identity to single-digit milliseconds without pretending an arktype-backed
schema is free. The registry's own validation then stays out of the identity leaf on purpose:

- **Tier 1 — committed source (provider metadata modules): plain TypeScript.** They are not a trust
  boundary; they are type-checked source. `as const satisfies` plus discriminated unions give full
  inference at zero runtime cost.
- **Tier 2 — process boundaries (env, argv, `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`, JSON artifacts): arktype morphs.**
  These are genuinely untrusted, crossed repeatedly, and currently guarded ad hoc. One parser per
  boundary, narrowed literal types out the other side.
- **Tier 3 — generator and gates (build time): arktype for invariants types can't express.** The
  240 ms arktype import is free in a generator that runs on demand, so the descriptor schema and its `.narrow()`
  rules live here, not in the hot import path.

The original parser and partition prototypes were verified against arktype 2.2.0 and the repo's
strict TypeScript settings. The refinements accepted here—especially the arktype-free identity leaf,
correlated metadata modules, and raw-versus-resolved input views—MUST land with positive and
`@ts-expect-error` compiler tests; this ADR does not present unexecuted samples as prior evidence.

### Registry authoring: central identity, one inert metadata file per provider

A single 1,000-line registry literal would become the next merge-conflict hotspot as the fleet
grows. Keep the published vocabulary centralized in `PROVIDER_IDS`, but author metadata in pure,
SDK-free files:

```text
packages/schema/src/provider-meta/
  e2b.ts  daytona-vm.ts  tama.ts  …       filename = ProviderId
  _daytona.ts                              shared pricing/evidence constants
  index.ts                                 generated typed assembly
```

Each provider file default-exports
`defineProviderMeta("tama", { displayName, pricing, artifact, inputs, … })`. The helper performs no
validation; it returns `{ id, meta }` while preserving both literals. The generated `index.ts`
follows `PROVIDER_IDS` outward, imports exactly those metadata modules, checks them through the
correlated type `{ [P in ProviderId]: ProviderMetaModule<P> }`, and exports their `meta` fields as
`REGISTRY` with
`as const satisfies Record<ProviderId, Omit<ProviderMeta, "id">>`. A file whose declared id does not
match its generated key is therefore a compile error, not merely a filename gate finding.

This is not the rejected fleet inversion in ADR-0007 §8. Deleting a metadata file cannot shrink the
provider vocabulary: the central tuple remains authoritative and the generated import fails to
compile. The generator evaluates only inert schema metadata, never driver modules or vendor SDKs.
Sharding therefore buys parallel authoring and local review without giving file discovery ownership
of identity.

### 1. Model the artifact as a discriminated union, and derive the partitions (Tier 1)

```ts
export type ProviderArtifact =
  | { kind: "none" }                                  // blaxel: vendor stock image
  | { kind: "image" }                                 // modal, namespace, runcloud, microsandbox
  | { kind: "baked"; nameSuffix?: string }            // e2b, daytona-*, novita, runloop
  | { kind: "mirror"; repository: string }            // vercel
  | { kind: "built"; recipe: string };                 // modal-gpu: image built at run time
```

The registry owns the artifact's **lifecycle**, not vendor API syntax. Fields such as
`snapshotId`, `templateId`, `blueprint_name`, and CLI flags belong in the driver that invokes that
API (ADR-0007). Keeping an `optionKey` in the registry would merely move the current hand-written
switch into data, would not represent nested or transformed vendor requests, and would make a
future non-ComputeSDK provider contort itself around an obsolete passthrough convention.

`built` covers artifacts that cannot be a committed ref because they are constructed in-process —
the GPU lane's dockerfileCommands image resolved through a content-keyed kernel-snapshot cache.
The registry names only the **recipe**; the composition root produces the concrete
`ResolvedArtifact.ref` at run time (ADR-0007 §3). This is what lets `modal-gpu` join the registry
instead of routing around it — and therefore puts its driver-module execution policy under
ADR-0008's conformance gate,
where today they are a hand-carried const (`gpu/modal.ts:14-18`).

With `REGISTRY` exported as
`as const satisfies Record<ProviderId, Omit<ProviderMeta, "id">>`, the *type system*
partitions the providers:

```ts
type IdsWithArtifact<K extends ProviderArtifact["kind"]> = {
  [P in ProviderId]: (typeof REGISTRY)[P]["artifact"]["kind"] extends K ? P : never;
}[ProviderId];

export type BakedProviderId = IdsWithArtifact<"baked">;
```

`bakers` then becomes `Record<BakedProviderId, BakeFn>`, which is the payoff:

- the **seven no-op bakers become unconstructable** — giving `blaxel` a baker is a compile error;
- **omitting a real one is a compile error**, so the map stays exhaustive over exactly the right set;
- `baseImageUse` and `providerArtifact` collapse into reads off `artifact`, narrowed by `kind`
  with no casts; `CandidateRefs` stays release-lane composition-root data (resolved
  candidate/version refs), not artifact metadata; `candidateCreateOptions` disappears because the
  validation lane passes a resolved artifact to the selected driver instead of manufacturing
  vendor options in the CLI;
- `bake` and `promote` call **one** map, differing only in the name they pass.

All three negative cases above were verified to fail `tsc --strict` as intended. This is the
"behavior follows from the narrowed type" property, and it costs nothing at runtime — arktype here
would buy strictly less than the compiler already gives.

### 2. One provider-identity parser for every boundary crossing (Tier 2)

This is where arktype earns the most, because it replaces five ad-hoc validators with one:

```ts
export const providerId = type.enumerated(...PROVIDER_IDS);

/** CSV → typed ids. The only thing `--provider`, BENCH_PROVIDERS and plan-axis should use. */
export const providerSelection = type("string")
  .pipe((raw) => raw.split(",").map((s) => s.trim()).filter(Boolean))
  .to(providerId.array().atLeastLength(1));
```

Verified: the result infers as the literal union (a `readonly ("e2b")[]` annotation is correctly
rejected), and a typo produces
`value at [1] must be "daytona-vm", "e2b", … (was "typo-provider")` — strictly better than today's
hand-rolled message. `selectProviders`/`selectRegistryIds` and `plan-axis.ts`'s `string[]` erasure
and internal `JSON.stringify`/`JSON.parse` round-trip all go away; `AxisPlanConfig.select` becomes
typed rather than `=> string[]`.

### 3. Parse the cross-process JSON artifacts (Tier 2)

The release plan, the bake report and the GHA matrix are written by one process and consumed by
another through a workflow output. Use the built-in keyword rather than a bare morph:

```ts
export const releaseMatrix = type("string.json.parse").to({
  include: type({ provider: providerId, required: "boolean" }).array(),
});
```

`type("string.json.parse")` reports `must be a JSON string (SyntaxError: …)`, where
`.pipe.try(JSON.parse)` degrades to `must be valid according to an anonymous predicate` — useless in
a CI log. A bad id reports `include[0].provider must be …`, with the path.

### 4. Split global config from provider inputs (Tier 2)

The current `config.ts` mixes repo-global toolchain overrides with provider credentials and then
hand-syncs `envSchema` against `ENV_KEYS`. Split the boundary in two. Repo-global values keep a
small schema whose keys are recovered from `envSchema.props`; provider inputs are selected from the
registry descriptor in §6 and parsed only for the chosen provider. In both cases the parallel key
array disappears:

```ts
const declared = envSchema.props.map((p) => p.key as string);

/** process.env → validated repo-global input. Empty ⇒ unset stays the rule. */
export const repoEnv = type("Record<string, string | undefined>")
  .pipe((raw) => Object.fromEntries(
    declared.flatMap((k) => (raw[k] ? [[k, raw[k]]] : [])),
  ))
  .to(envSchema);

/** raw input → only this provider's normalized, defaulted DriverContext.env. */
export const parseDriverInputs = <P extends ProviderId>(id: P, raw: EnvSource): EnvOf<P> =>
  envSchemaFor(id)(raw);
```

The CLI composition root calls both once. Driver modules and templates receive explicit values and
never read ambient `process.env`; ADR-0007 owns the package migration that removes the old global
provider config object.

### 5. Declare what consumers currently sniff (Tier 1)

```ts
vendor: string;                                                   // "Daytona" — kills figureProviderName's prefix map
isolation: { technology: string; class: "microVM" | "container" | "userspace" | "unknown" };
```

`isolationClass` and `isolationFromDeclaration` become field reads. `isolationFromRuntime` **stays a
matcher** — it maps *observed* strings from the guest probe, which the registry cannot know in
advance. That is the line between domain modeling and genuine parsing. Create-error classification
does not join this list: vendor errors are behavior, so ADR-0007 requires drivers to translate them
to a typed `SandboxCreateError`. Regexes may exist privately inside a legacy bridge, but they are not
registry claims that every consumer must reinterpret.

### 6. Provider-input descriptors with a normalizing morph (Tiers 2 + 3)

`requiredEnvVars: string[]` cannot distinguish secrets, ordinary variables, generated step values,
optional tuning, or values with defaults. Replace it with `inputs`, keep the string shorthand for a
required secret, and normalize once so no consumer handles two shapes:

```ts
const inputSource = type({ kind: "'secret'" })
  .or({ kind: "'variable'" })
  .or({ kind: "'step-env'", step: "string >= 1" })
  .or({ kind: "'step-output'", step: "string >= 1", output: "string >= 1" });

const providerInput = type("string >= 1").or({
  name: "string >= 1",
  "source?": inputSource,
  "required?": "boolean",
  "default?": "string >= 1",            // DAYTONA_TARGET → "us-west-2"
  "ciValue?": "string >= 1",            // MICROSANDBOX_LOCAL_BENCH → "1" in CI
});

export const input = providerInput.pipe((c) =>
  typeof c === "string"
    ? { name: c, source: { kind: "secret" as const }, required: true }
    : { ...c, source: c.source ?? { kind: "secret" as const },
        required: c.required ?? (c.default === undefined) },
);
```

Verified: mixed shorthand/full input normalizes to one shape, and `""` is rejected at
`value at [0] must be non-empty`. A step-provided environment value names its producer step; a step
output names both step and output, so the emitter never guesses provenance from an env name. Tier-3
narrows reject a default on a secret, step env, or step output; reject `ciValue` anywhere except an
ordinary variable; and reject a required input with a default. Reusing the same `name` across provider
variants is the declaration that they share it; a parallel `sharedWith` list would be another drift
surface.

The YAML emitter consumes the normalized record and re-checks nothing. `EnvOf` and
`envSchemaFor` derive two deliberately different views from it: the **raw** boundary permits an
optional or defaulted input to be absent, while the **resolved** `DriverContext.env` makes a
defaulted input a required `string` and leaves only genuinely optional inputs as `string |
undefined`. This avoids the common mistake where a default is modeled as optional all the way into
driver code. The descriptor is the single declaration behind CI wiring, compile-time access, and
runtime parsing. Two further Tier-1 fields cover the remaining per-provider CI facts that are
ternaries in YAML today: `runner?: { label: string; noCache: boolean; lifetimeMinutes?: number }`
and `preAuth?: "namespace-token" | "vercel-auth"`. Runner routing, setup cache policy, and the
advertised reaping budget are one structured declaration because all three are properties of the
same runner label; Tier-3 rejects providers that assign contradictory policies to a shared label.

### 7. Generate the managed regions, gate them the way ADR-0003 gates the catalog (Tier 3)

Not whole-workflow codegen — the workflows carry hand-tuned logic worth keeping. Marker-delimited
**managed regions**, exactly the `generate-catalog` → `check-catalog-drift` pattern:

```yaml
# >>> generated: provider-credentials — bun run generate-provider-wiring
          E2B_API_KEY: ${{ matrix.provider == 'e2b' && secrets.E2B_API_KEY || '' }}
# <<< end generated
```

Regions: the three provider-input blocks, `bench-smoke.yml`'s choice options,
`docs/ci-secrets.md:208-227`, `scripts/setup-privileged-environment.sh:57-62`, and `.env.example`.
`bun run check:provider-wiring` re-runs the generator and `git diff --exit-code`s — byte-identical to
`check-catalog-drift.ts:14-30`.

The generator is also where the descriptor's **arktype schema** lives: the invariants currently
asserted only in `providers.test.ts` (required provider inputs are non-empty; defaults are valid for
their source; variants of one vendor share a pricing object) become `.narrow()` rules on a
schema the generator runs, so they are enforced against the descriptor *before* it is allowed to emit
CI wiring that grants secrets. Paying arktype's import in a build-time generator is free; paying it
in the provider identity leaf every CLI bin and harness process imports is not.

`bench-matrix.yml:64`'s default CSV stays hand-edited: joining the published matrix is a deliberate
promotion decision, not a mechanical consequence of registering, and the 18-line rationale above it
is real content. `workflow-sync.ts` invariants 1 and 3 are deleted as redundant — a generated region
cannot drift from its generator. Invariants 2, 3b, 4–7 are unrelated to onboarding and stay.
Pre-auth steps stay hand-written (Vercel's VCR mirror is ~50 bespoke lines), while their mechanical
owner-aware `if` expressions are generated for benchmark, bake, and promote. A structural gate also
requires every provider declaring `preAuth` to have that exact producer step in all three jobs.

### 8. Close the loop: the generator emits `as const satisfies`

Generated TypeScript is re-checked by `tsc`, so arktype validates the generator's *input* and the
compiler validates its *output*. Neither is trusted blindly, and a generator bug that emits a
malformed registry fails typecheck rather than shipping.

### 9. Then, and only then, scaffold

`bun run new-provider <id>` takes a small descriptor file, parses it with the Tier-3 schema, appends
the `PROVIDER_IDS` entry, creates `packages/schema/src/provider-meta/<id>.ts`, stubs
`packages/drivers/src/<id>.ts` (and `apps/cli/src/lib/bake/<id>.ts`
only when `artifact.kind === "baked"`), and runs the generators.

Scaffolding is deliberately last. Generating 22 edit sites is not an improvement over typing them —
it makes duplication cheaper to create and no cheaper to maintain. It is worth writing once §1–§7
have cut its output to three files.

### Oracles

Keep the hardcoded list in `providers.test.ts:24-39` — that is the independent oracle and it earns
its place. The rest dissolve: `validate.test.ts`'s three partition oracles become tautologies once
§1 derives the partitions at the type level, and the remaining three assert properties over
`PROVIDERS` instead of re-listing membership.

## Consequences

**Adding a provider becomes:** one `PROVIDER_IDS` tuple entry → one provider-metadata file → one driver
file → optionally one bake file →
`bun run generate-provider-wiring` → review the generated diff. Three hand-edited files against
25–34 today, with the `bench-matrix.yml` promotion still a separate, deliberate step.

**We accept:**

- **A wider `ProviderMeta`.** Identity, economics, artifact lifecycle and CI wiring live in one
  descriptor. Resolved candidate/version refs do not: the composition root derives those from the
  release lane. The alternative is today's status quo: the
  same facts across nine files with no gate. It stays declarative data; no builder or workflow logic
  moves into `schema`.
- **Two representations of the descriptor contract** — a TypeScript type (Tier 1, for inference) and
  an arktype schema (Tier 3, for the generator's narrows). They can drift. The mitigation is that
  the generator asserts the committed registry against the schema, so drift fails the gate rather
  than shipping. Collapsing them by inferring the type *from* the schema is the obvious
  simplification and is explicitly rejected here: it would pin the registry's validation cost into
  the identity leaf, which this ADR wants to get *back* to single-digit milliseconds.
- **Generated YAML regions.** Reviewers read a generated diff, and a bad generator ships bad wiring
  everywhere at once. ADR-0003 already accepted this trade; the drift gate is the same mechanism.
- **A migration touching every provider.** §1, §5 and §6 rewrite 14 registry entries and delete six
  switches. Large but mechanically backstopped (`Record<ProviderId, …>`, exhaustive switches, and
  ADR-0007's correlated loader); it should land alone, with no new provider riding along.
- **`workflow-hardening.test.ts`'s provider-specific asserts stay hand-maintained.** The Vercel
  `toHaveLength(3)` count and the scoped `RUNLOOP_API_KEY`/`RUN_CLOUD_API_KEY` expression pins are
  security invariants about *specific* providers, not derivable facts. They are correctly special.

**We explicitly do not:** put vendor option names or create-error regexes in the registry; validate
the registry at import time in `schema/providers` (it would add
cost to the identity leaf for guarantees `tsc` already provides on committed source); parse the
registry at runtime in the harness or CLI; or replace `isolationFromRuntime`'s matcher, which
handles genuinely open input. This ADR does not define the driver port; ADR-0007 owns that migration.
