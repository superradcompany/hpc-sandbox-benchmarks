# Methodology

How a number in this repo's dataset is produced, and the caveats that keep it comparable across
providers and over time.

## North star

Compare sandbox **providers**, not bare-metal hardware. Every provider is asked to run the same
workloads on the same pinned spec, and the results are normalized into one schema-validated dataset.

Where a vendor exposes more than one **isolation technology**, each is a first-class provider variant
so the comparison attributes results to the isolation the sandbox actually used: `daytona-vm` (a
`SandboxClass.LINUX_VM` microVM) vs `daytona-container` (a Sysbox/OCI container), and `modal-gvisor`
(Modal's default gVisor runtime) vs `modal-vm` (Modal's gVisor-free VM runtime). Each provider's
declared isolation is the authoritative label and is shown in the leaderboard's **Providers in this
run** roster, beside a best-effort **detected** class from an in-sandbox probe (gVisor kernel marker;
a cgroup quota far below the disclosed host ⇒ container; a self-sized hypervisor ⇒ VM). The probe
cannot separate every type — a container and a microVM can both report `kvm`; gVisor and a microVM can
both report `unknown` — so it is only a cross-check that flags a declared/detected contradiction, never
a source of truth.

## Target spec

Every provider is created at one pinned [`TARGET_SPEC`](../packages/schema/src/target-spec.ts): **4 vCPU,
8 GiB RAM, 40 GB disk**. 8 GiB RAM fits inside every provider's reproducible envelope (E2B caps sandbox
RAM at 8 GiB); vCPU is pinned at 4 because Blaxel couples CPU to RAM (8 GiB forces 4 vCPU there), so
targeting 4 lets every provider — Blaxel included — match on the same shape. A provider that can't express a dimension
runs with its actuals recorded and the mismatch disclosed (`specMatched`). Its measurements stay in the
rankings, but the leaderboard flags the provider with an explicit **Comparability warning** naming its
observed allocation, so its ranks are never read as like-for-like with the compute-matched providers.

Vercel exposes only a vCPU resource knob and derives memory at 2048 MB per vCPU, so requesting four
vCPU reaches the 8 GiB target as a coupled point. Its SDK does not expose a disk-size knob; available
disk is measured in the guest and disk-gated suites skip honestly when the observed mount is too small.

## Dimensions and metrics

Results land on a closed, ordered set of [`DIMENSIONS`](../packages/schema/src/metrics.ts): `lifecycle`,
`control-plane`, `cpu`, `disk`, `memory`, `network`, `system`, `realworld`, `economics`. Each catalogued
[`MetricDef`](../packages/schema/src/metrics.ts) declares its `dimension`, `unit`, `direction` (HIB =
higher-is-better, LIB = lower-is-better), and whether it `headline`s its dimension. A dimension has at
most one headline metric (enforced at catalog load); the leaderboard ranks *every* emitted metric and
leads each dimension with its headline.

### How the leaderboard is laid out

Which sections exist is driven by the data — a dimension no provider emitted is simply absent — but the
order and the emphasis are editorial, and they follow this document's argument:

- **`realworld` leads, and it is drawn rather than tabulated.** Synthetic scores say what the hardware
  *can* do; the real-world suites say what a developer or a CI job actually waits on, which is the
  question the benchmark exists to answer. That section opens with one stacked chart per repo — see
  [The realworld charts](#the-realworld-charts) — and folds its per-task tables behind a `<details>`.
- **The synthetic microbenchmarks collapse.** `cpu`, `disk`, `memory`, `network` and `system` each load
  one hardware axis in isolation, so their tables render inside a collapsed `<details>`. The `##`
  heading stays outside it: a measured axis must never look like one that never ran.
- **Everything else stays expanded.** `lifecycle` and `control-plane` are harness-measured timings of
  the provider's own API — a spawn a user waits on, not a synthetic load — and `economics` is the
  provider's published price. None is a microbenchmark, so none is hidden.

The header links each identifier to its primary source: the run id to the `bench-matrix` workflow run
that produced the measurements, the commit to the tree they were measured against, and the dataset link
to the committed Run document the tables were rendered from — so any number on the page can be traced
back to its raw Samples. (A Run spliced from two CI runs — a composite `<runA>+<runB>` id, see
[`data/dataset/index.json`](../data/dataset/index.json) — links each half separately; no single workflow
run owns the pair.) The order, the collapse, and the links are all gated
against the committed artifact by `tooling/repo-checks/src/leaderboard-artifact-sync.test.ts`.

### The realworld charts

Each chart is one repo. Each bar is one environment's whole pipeline for that repo; each segment is one
task, in the suite's real execution order, coloured on an ordinal ramp so colour order *is* execution
order. Rows sort fastest-first and the fastest is badged.

Four properties are load-bearing, and each one is a claim the picture would otherwise make silently:

- **A bar is the SUM OF THE PER-TASK MEDIANS, not the median of any pipeline that ran.** In a stacked
  bar the segments must add up to the bar — that is what stacking means — so the total is arithmetic
  over the same p50s the tables below print, and no single execution ever took exactly that long. The
  caption under every chart says so.
- **All charts share one time scale.** A second is the same length in every one of them, so the
  repos can be read against each other. Scaling each chart to its own maximum would make unrelated
  pictures out of one comparison.
- **An environment is charted only if it completed EVERY task the suite exercised.** Summing the tasks a
  provider did run and drawing it beside providers that ran them all would show a fast bar for an
  environment that skipped the work — the same "a gap is not a zero" rule the tables follow.
- **Environments that did not complete the suite are listed under the bars**, with the outcome and the
  reason the run recorded. Dropping them would turn a chart that discloses its gaps into one that
  appears to have none.

A suite is charted only when at least two environments completed it; with fewer, the section keeps its
tables in the open, because hiding numbers behind a triangle whose figures do not exist would take them
off the page entirely.

Each chart is drawn from one self-contained HTML document (inline styles, fonts inlined as `data:`
URIs, no script) built deterministically from the committed Run, then screenshotted by headless Chrome
at 2× and committed as a WebP that the Markdown embeds at logical size via `<img width>`. The split
matters for what can be checked where: the HTML is byte-deterministic everywhere, so
`leaderboard-artifact-sync` re-derives the figure list from the Run, checks the document links exactly
that set, that each committed WebP has the promised geometry, and that the chart HTML renders the same
bytes twice — all without a browser. The pixels themselves are Chrome's, and Chrome's rasterisation is
not byte-stable across machines, so they are authored in one place: the *Update leaderboard* workflow,
which provisions the browser build its lockfile pins via `scripts/pin-chrome.sh` (the same script a
maintainer can use for a pinned local render), rasterises every chart twice, and fails on a byte
mismatch. A raster cannot be reviewed as a diff —
which is exactly why the per-task tables stay one click below the charts as the auditable receipts.

Metrics come from three sources:

- **PTS-derived** — generated from vendored Phoronix Test Suite profiles (see the
  [ADR-0003](./adr/0003-generated-pts-catalog-and-drift-gate.md)). The generator owns the
  XML-derived fields and id-uniqueness; a hand-authored override map supplies editorial fields.
  A `<Result>` maps onto the catalog by its versionless test + `<Description>`; profiles whose
  parsers post several scales under one description (fio: bandwidth + IOPS from a single run) get
  one metric per scale, disambiguated by a `pts.scale` pin the mapping also matches on.
- **Harness-measured** — lifecycle (spawn/exec/snapshot/teardown) and control-plane (info/list)
  timings PTS can't see, measured directly around the provider SDK calls.
- **Derived (economics)** — never measured; computed from pricing + measured runtime (below).

## Economics ($/run)

The `economics` dimension is exact-only. The cited registry in
[`providers.ts`](../packages/schema/src/providers.ts) retains each official component rate, original
vendor unit, billing basis, intrinsic quantity rule, allowances/fees, source URL, and verification
date. A component does not store a quantity for the current benchmark shape: its vendor billing-unit
quantity is derived from each Run's `TargetSpec` when pricing is applied. `usd_per_hour` is emitted
only when those components form a **complete deterministic CPU-plus-memory charge** for that Run's
requested allocation. Runtime-prorated `usd_per_lifecycle` and `usd_per_compute_run` require that same
exact hourly denominator; a null hourly total emits none of the three metrics and never reads as zero.

This distinction keeps published-but-dynamic providers visible and auditable without ranking an
assumption:

- **Modal is usage-dependent.** Modal bills `max(request, usage)`. Request-equals-limit does not prove
  the quantities Modal ultimately billed, so catalog rates remain metadata but produce no exact
  economics rows without sandbox-scoped provider-observed usage.
- **Blaxel and Vercel are unranked** because CPU is active-use billed. Their cited 100%-active values
  (`$0.3312/hr` and `$0.6816/hr`) are useful references, not observed totals for I/O-heavy Runs.
- **run.cloud is unranked** because `$0.0593784/hr` is only its reserved CPU floor plus provisioned
  memory; CPU burst above that floor is separately metered and the historical Runs do not retain it.
- **Microsandbox Cloud and Namespace are unranked** because the applicable total depends on plan fees,
  included monthly pools, and prepaid/overage consumption.

Provider-observed `costEvidence` is separate from catalog-derived economics. Run v5 retains one
record per benchmark sandbox cell. `observed` means the provider hook returned a structurally valid,
sandbox-attributed public API result after confirmed teardown; schema validation does not independently
authenticate that external response. `missing` records why a usable result is unavailable and never
means zero. `providerCostTotal(records, expectedCells)` produces an exact total only relative to the
authoritative expected cells supplied by its caller: the record cells must equal that set exactly and
all records must be observed, cell-unique, sandbox-unique, and use one currency. Modal currently records `unsupported_public_api`: its generated
resource-usage RPC is private and is not called. run.cloud records `not_sandbox_scoped`: its public
usage API is organization-wide cumulative usage and is not called or delta-attributed to one sandbox.

Run v6 separately retains `artifactEvidence` for every benchmark sandbox cell. The host writes the
requested provider artifact before probing the sandbox. Canonical release refs are upgraded to
`guest-fingerprint` only after the running guest reports the expected toolchain manifest; the schema,
not the producer, derives that expectation from the provider/artifact mapping and release constants.
Thus matching producer-supplied claims cannot manufacture verification, a stale manifest fails before
benchmarking, and a noncanonical override remains visible as `request-fallback` rather than being
silently treated as verified. The record carries run, provider, suite, replicate, and sandbox identity
through normalization and aggregation.

Allowances remain metadata, never headline discounts: Daytona's first 5 GiB is a **per-sandbox disk
allowance**, not free memory, and monthly pools cannot establish the intrinsic cost of one sandbox
hour. Disk rates and allowances are retained where published but excluded from economics because disk
is not a benchmark comparison axis and rates are not uniformly available. Economics enriches a
provider only after it produced at least one measured metric, so it never promotes a pending row.

## Host vs. effective specs (the host-fingerprint caveat)

`ObservedSpecs` splits what a Run saw into two sides:

- **Effective** (`vcpus`/`memoryGb`/`diskGb`) — the sandbox's actual size (cgroup quota where enforced),
  from the in-sandbox spec probe.
- **Host** (`hostVcpus`/`hostMemoryGb`/`cpuModel`/…) — the underlying machine, parsed from the PTS
  composite's `<System>` block.

In a container `<System>` discloses the **host** (e.g. a 48-thread EPYC), not the 4-vCPU sandbox quota.
The normalizer therefore maps `<System>` only to the host side and merges it **under** the spec probe,
so a host disclosure can never masquerade as the sandbox's effective size. Forensic logs are captured as
a `*--forensics.tar.gz` tarball (a tarball, not loose files, so nested `.xml` can't be misrouted).

PTS `MONITOR`/sensor data is deliberately **not** collected: it's host-level (unattributable per
provider) and its empty-`<Identifier>` `<Result>` nodes would abort extraction — the producer unsets
`MONITOR`.

## Transport model

Providers differ in how their `@computesdk/*` adapter executes a command. Each declares a
[`ProviderTransport`](../packages/schema/src/providers.ts) capability (`streaming`, `syncCapMs`,
`detachedPoll`), and the harness selects a transport per step: a step that could reach the integration's
synchronous durability threshold runs **detached + poll** where supported, everything else runs directly.
That threshold may be a measured/vendor limit (for example Daytona's server-side HTTP 408) or a
conservative policy where one long connection is unvalidated. Vercel uses a 60-second policy threshold,
so 20–80-minute suites such as Mastra launch detached and remain observable through short polls.

## The dataset pipeline

1. **Run** — `bench-suite <provider> <suite> <runId> --replicates <indices>` boots one sandbox per
   replicate index (concurrently, from one process), runs the suite's mise tasks in each, pulls the raw
   trees (`data/raw/<runId>/r<idx>/<provider>/<suite>/`), and normalizes each into its own shard Run
   document (`data/runs/<runId>-r<idx>.json`) stamped with that replicate index. `--replicate <idx>` is
   the single-sandbox spelling, writing the un-suffixed `data/runs/<runId>.json`.
2. **Matrix** — the `bench-matrix` workflow plans three axes (`plan-providers` / `plan-suites` /
   `plan-replicates`), then one suite-matrix job calls the reusable `bench-suite` workflow per suite
   (GitHub-native nesting: `<suite> / <provider>`), fanning out over the selected providers; each
   `(provider, suite)` cell drives that suite's whole replicate fleet itself and uploads all its shard
   Runs as one artifact. **Replicates are not a runner axis.** A bench runner is idle for essentially
   its whole life — it creates a sandbox and polls it — so a runner per replicate billed R idle runners
   to do one runner's work (324 runners where 54 suffice, at the shipped defaults). Driving the fleet
   in-process leaves the sandbox count, provider load, and wall clock unchanged (the cell's wall clock
   is its slowest replicate, not their sum) while the runner bill stops scaling with R. Isolation is
   preserved: every replicate runs to completion and writes its shard even when a peer dies, and the
   cell goes red at the end if any did. Two axes are the statistical knobs, both defaulting to the per-suite schema
   config so a bare dispatch already carries the intended statistical power for separating providers
   (subject to the genuine near-tie limit noted below — no sample size resolves providers that are truly
   within a few percent):
   - **replicates** — R sandboxes per cell, the between-machine axis (`replicas` blank = each suite's
     `Suite.defaultReplicas`: synthetic R=3, realworld **R=12**, sized from the committed dataset's
     observed between-machine variance so realworld provider CIs separate; a number overrides every suite).
   - **PTS passes** — the within-machine axis (`pts_passes` blank = each suite's own policy). The `memory`
     and `cpu-node` suites **converge** via PTS's `DynamicRunCount` — both are cheap or CPU-bound enough that
     convergence settles near its ~3-pass minimum without a runaway. Every other suite keeps a **fixed** pass
     count, because convergence there re-introduces fio's runaway (20–40 runs) on `disk`, timed `system` out
     at its budget on modal-gvisor (SQLite's I/O variance) in a converge run, breaks `iperf`'s fixed-trial
     rule on `network`, or is a k=1 cold-start whose install/build IS the metric (realworld). Everything
     fixed carries its spread via replicates, not in-sandbox repeats; a number or `converge` forces one
     policy across every suite.

   The `bench-smoke` workflow is this same step, narrowed: the same plan action over a single
   dispatched provider and suite, calling the same reusable `bench-suite` workflow, defaulting to one
   replicate — and then stopping. It has no step 3, so a smoke run exercises the live lane end to end
   (credentials, sandbox lifecycle, the in-sandbox producer, normalization, artifacts) without moving
   the published dataset. Its one behavioural difference is that it *requires* its dispatched provider
   to reach `validated`, so a missing credential fails the run rather than being recorded as a skip.
3. **Aggregate → promote → commit** — the `commit-dataset` workflow (the matrix's `publish` job calls
   it) collects every shard, `aggregate`s them into one candidate Run (measured metrics unioned, the ≥2
   replicate sandboxes of one `(provider, suite)` folded into per-metric replicate breakdowns, economics
   re-derived from the merged set), then `promote`s it (gate: ≥1 validated provider) into the committed
   dataset at `data/dataset/` with a newest-first index, and opens a PR to land it on `main`. This step
   commits only the machine-readable dataset — it never touches `LEADERBOARD.md`.
4. **Leaderboard** — the `update-leaderboard` workflow renders a chosen committed Run into a ranked
   Markdown table per dimension (`leaderboard`) and opens a PR to update `LEADERBOARD.md`. It is a
   deliberate, maintainer-dispatched step (default: the newest committed run), so the dataset can grow a
   run per matrix run while the public comparison surface only moves when someone updates it. See
   [CI & secrets](./ci-secrets.md) rule 7.
5. **Stability gate** — `stability <prev> <cur>` flags any provider metric that shifted beyond the noise
   threshold across Runs, comparing only provenance-matched (same `appVersion` + `arguments`) metrics.

Every Run is validated against the schema at the producer boundary, so no malformed Run reaches a
consumer. The whole pipeline is reproducible: a committed `bun.lock`, vendored PTS profiles, and a
byte-stable catalog held by the drift gate.
