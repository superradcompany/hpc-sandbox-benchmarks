# collects as real provenance, indistinguishable from a probe that ran and measured nothing. Staging
# means the artifact appears only when there is an artifact.
#
# A REFUSED write also removes any artifact already at that path. Staleness is the worse failure: a
# rerun into a directory that still holds the last run's file would otherwise leave it there for the

#
# Validation degrades with the toolchain: where jq exists the bytes must parse, where it does not
# they must at least be non-empty, so a jq-less sandbox still gets the truncation guard. Returns 1
# when nothing was installed — including when the rename itself failed, which must never read as
# success — leaving the caller to log the diagnostic it is in a position to explain (`(no structured
