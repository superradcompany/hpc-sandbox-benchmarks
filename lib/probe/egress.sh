# Public-egress identity: which address a sandbox leaves from, which network announces it, and where
# that network is. Sourced after lib/bench.sh:
#
#   source "${REPO_ROOT}/lib/probe/egress.sh"
#   egress_probe          # sets PUBLIC_IP ASN ORG_NAME ORG PREFIX ASN_SOURCE

#
# Lives here rather than inside the provider task because it answers a question about the SANDBOX'S
# NETWORK, which is independent of the isolation question the task's other half answers, and because
# any network leaf that wants to name its egress can source it without pulling in the isolation
# engine.
#
# WHAT THE ASN ACTUALLY IS: the network that announces the sandbox's public egress IP. It is a
# network fact, not a hardware one. A sandbox NATs its egress through the provider's own network, so
# this names whoever owns the address block the traffic leaves from — which may be the underlying
# host cloud (Oracle, AWS) rather than the vendor you buy from (Daytona, Novita), or a transit/proxy
# network belonging to neither.
#
# WHY NOT ipinfo.io FOR THE ASN. Anonymous ipinfo is quota'd per source IP, and a matrix fan-out
# behind one NAT egress makes many anonymous calls. On a 429 it returns a JSON error body, `.org`
# resolves to empty, and the provider column silently reads "unknown" — indistinguishable from a
# sandbox we genuinely could not identify. So the ASN comes from Team Cymru's DNS whois instead:
# authoritative BGP origin data, no HTTP, no quota, no install, and no key. ipinfo is retained only
# for city/region, and its failure is recorded in `geo_source` rather than blanking the identity.
#
# Tolerant throughout: every leg is capped and every failure is a recorded source, never an abort.

# Keep only the first line that IS an address of the leg's family. Validation must happen PER LEG:
# dig prints multi-record answers (edns-client-subnet lines) and even failure diagnostics (";;
# communications error …") to stdout under +short, and a proxy can serve HTML to curl — any
# non-empty garbage accepted here would short-circuit the remaining legs and yield no IP on a
