# this file (and realworld-runner.sh, adjacent here) into the installed profile dir, where PTS
# executes it as the profile's install.sh. All per-repo config lives in target.env. Copies
# target.env + the runner from $(dirname "$0") into the install dir, writes the PTS executable
# wrapper each profile declares via <Executable>realworld-run</Executable> (receiving the selected
# Task Option's Value as $1, stdout/stderr piped to $LOG_FILE), then does
# the UNMEASURED provisioning: pin the toolchain, shallow-fetch the pinned SHA into work/, one warm
# install -- so every measured task starts from a deps-ready workspace. See realworld-runner.sh for
# the per-task measured logic the wrapper invokes at batch-run.

# Warm the SAME cache locations realworld-runner.sh pins at run time (relative to this install
# dir, which is the runner's SCRIPT_DIR), so the unmeasured provisioning below populates exactly
# what the runner reads: a fresh COREPACK_HOME would otherwise make the first measured pnpm task
# of a batch pay a pnpm-toolchain download inside its sample. The runner's cold_install branch
# still wipes the store + XDG cache before measuring, so this never warms a cold-install sample.
# The store pins are load-bearing, not cosmetic: pnpm 11 ignores npm_config_store_dir and resolves
# its store from PNPM_HOME first, then <XDG_DATA_HOME>/pnpm/store/v<n> (see the matching pins and
# the precedence note in realworld-runner.sh). Without BOTH, this warm install would populate the
# shared $HOME store, which the runner's cold reset cannot wipe (and must not, since it is not
# ours) -- every measured cold_install would then be a warm store hit. PNPM_HOME especially: images
# that ship the `ENV PNPM_HOME=/pnpm` idiom would otherwise warm a store the reset never touches.
