# pnpm's content-addressable STORE is what makes an install cold or warm, and pinning it is the
# whole reason cold_install can claim to measure a cold install. Three knobs, because which one
# bites depends on the pnpm each profile's packageManager field pins. They are listed in pnpm's
# PRECEDENCE order, and all three must point inside SCRIPT_DIR: pinning only a lower-precedence one
# leaves the store wherever the higher-precedence knob says, which the wipe below then misses.
#   * PNPM_HOME -- HIGHEST precedence on pnpm 11 (verified against 11.5.0:
#     `PNPM_HOME=/tmp/ph XDG_DATA_HOME=/tmp/xdg pnpm store path` answers /tmp/ph/store/v11). Set by
#     pnpm's own standalone installer and by the common `ENV PNPM_HOME=/pnpm` Node/corepack
#     Dockerfile idiom, so on any such image an unpinned PNPM_HOME silently overrides the XDG pin.
#   * XDG_DATA_HOME -- what pnpm 11 derives its default store from when PNPM_HOME is unset
#     (<XDG_DATA_HOME>/pnpm/store/v<n>).
#   * npm_config_store_dir -- the npm-style config key. pnpm 11 NO LONGER READS IT (verified against
#     pnpm 11.2.2: `npm_config_store_dir=/tmp/x pnpm store path` still answers
#     ~/.local/share/pnpm/store/v11). Kept for older pnpm, which does honour it.
# Before this was pinned, every "cold" install on every realworld profile was a warm store hit: the
# reset wiped ${SCRIPT_DIR}/.pnpm-store, a directory pnpm 11 never created, while the real 2.8 GB
# store sat untouched in $HOME (openclaw cold_install: 10.7s, "reused 1129, downloaded 0").
