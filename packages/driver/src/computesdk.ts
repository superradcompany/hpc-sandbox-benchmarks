// The ComputeSDK bridge (ADR-0007 §6): computesdk keeps all its real value — maintained vendor
// translations — as ONE driver among several. Native SDK modules reuse this structural session
// machinery through _native.ts, preserving their own native handle and typed errors.
//
// The bridge is a MethodTable, not a hand-assembled driver, so it flows through the same
// assembly layer as every other driver (table.ts) and inherits its session invariants for free:
// central output capping, the use-after-destroy guard, and artifact reconciliation. It is also
// deliberately STRUCTURAL: this private bridge declares the shape it consumes instead of importing
// computesdk itself. Two rules from ADR-0007 are load-bearing:
//
//   - `hasWorkingFilesystem` is EXPLICIT, because computesdk's UnsupportedFileSystem is a
//     truthy stub whose every method throws — the sentinel that killed a namespace step. The
//     stub is filtered here and never reaches a consumer.
//   - `native` is the WRAPPER's getInstance() value, typed by the wrapper's own vendored SDK —
//     never cast to this repo's copy of a vendor SDK. Wrappers vendor their own builds; the
//     classes are nominally different. Code that needs the repo's SDK types is code that
//     should be a native driver.
