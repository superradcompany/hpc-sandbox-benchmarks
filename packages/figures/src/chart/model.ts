/**
 * `better-auth` / `mastra` / `openclaw` — the view-model for one stacked pipeline chart.
 *
 * One builder over the model's own suite list rather than three near-copies: a suite added
 * upstream becomes a figure automatically and cannot be the one somebody forgot.
 *
 * This is the layer the tests hold onto. Everything the picture CLAIMS is decided here, as
 * plain data a unit test can assert on — the template below it only turns these fields into
 * markup, and the browser only rasterises what the template says:
 *
 *  - **Bars share ONE time scale across all charts** (`pipelineScaleMaxS`): a bar's
 *    `scaleFraction` is its total over the slowest charted total in the RUN, not in the
 *    suite. Scaling each chart to its own maximum would make three unrelated pictures out
 *    of one comparison.
 *  - **Segment order is the suite's real execution order**, one segment per task, coloured
 *    on the ordinal ramp by the phase's position IN THIS SUITE — later here is darker here,
 *    so "color order = execution order" is true by construction (a fixed phase→colour map
 *    could not promise that: suites disagree about order — openclaw checks before it tests).
 *  - **Rows are sorted fastest-first and the fastest is flagged.**
 *  - **Environments that did not complete the suite are listed under the bars** with their
 *    outcome and reason. Dropping them would turn a chart that discloses its gaps into one
 *    that appears to have none.
