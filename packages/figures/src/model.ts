 * rather than being imported as values: that is what lets every test below run against a
 * synthetic run and a synthetic catalog instead of whatever the committed dataset contains.

 * RunDoc shadow, a 449-line parse boundary for a document that never crosses a process
 * boundary here, and derivations — metric tables, coverage gaps, environment flags,

 * Firecracker microVM, so they report `machine_vmm=firecracker` AND `isolation_runtime=oci-container`
 * — both true. Reading `isolation_runtime` first returned the innermost layer and threw away the
 * hardware boundary, chipping two Firecracker microVMs as "Container · OCI" while the Markdown table
 * for the same run called them microVMs.
 *
 * The outer boundary wins because that is what the chip claims: the isolation the workload is
 * actually confined by, and the thing a reader comparing environments is weighing. It also puts this
 * derivation back in agreement with `packages/results`, whose roster treats the registry declaration
 * as authoritative and documents (see `isolationClass`) that the probe's container signal is a
 * cgroup-quota heuristic a microVM trips too — so it must never override a VM.
 *
 * `machine_vmm` is skipped when it is `not-observable` (Modal's gVisor cell, where no VMM is exposed
 * and `isolation_runtime=gvisor` is the correct answer) by the same emptiness filter below.
