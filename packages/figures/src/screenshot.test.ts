 * A construct-only probe is a liar on exactly the machines this skip exists for — a CI runner
 * can carry a DISCOVERABLE Chrome binary that dies at launch (sandbox restrictions; "Chrome
 * exited"), so `new Bun.WebView()` succeeds at collection time and the capture tests then fail
 * on machine shape rather than on code. The only probe that cannot drift from the module is the
 * module: any failure — no binary, dead-on-launch binary, wedged renderer — reads as "no working
 * Chrome" and the capture suite skips. On machines where it works, the probe's Chrome persists
 * (one spawn per process) and the tests below reuse it.
