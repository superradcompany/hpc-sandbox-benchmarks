/**
 * The package's ONLY impure module: a self-contained HTML document in, WebP bytes out, via
 * headless Chrome driven through `Bun.WebView`.
 *
 * Behind its own entry point (`@sandbox-benchmarks/figures/screenshot`) so that importing the
 * model or the template never spawns a browser. It returns BYTES AND NEVER WRITES — the caller
 * owns the filesystem, which is what lets a caller render into memory, compare two renders, or
 * write next to whatever document links the figure.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT PROMISED: byte determinism across machines. Chrome's rasterisation
 * depends on its version and platform; the pinned-browser CI job is where pixels are authored,
 * and the same-machine stability the CLI relies on (render twice, compare) is Chrome's, not
 * this module's. What IS checked here is the geometry: the decoded image must be exactly
 * `width × deviceScaleFactor` device pixels, or the capture semantics drifted and the figure
 * would be silently the wrong size — that throws.
 *
 * The flow leans on Bun's own helpers: the document is installed with one `evaluate`
 * (`document.write`, which keeps the doctype and therefore standards mode), fonts settle and
 * the body height is measured in the same round-trip, and the capture is the native
 * `view.screenshot()`. The one raw CDP call left is `Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride` —
 * the 2× density and the content-sized viewport have no Bun-native spelling yet.
