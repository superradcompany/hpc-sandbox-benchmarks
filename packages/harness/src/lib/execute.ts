 * provider's quirks:
 *
 *   - {@link StepRunner.run}: a direct synchronous exec. Fine for short steps, but NOT durable for
 *     long ones on a capped provider: Daytona's synchronous executeCommand returns HTTP 408 on
 *     multi-minute commands while the process keeps running server-side, and computesdk's Daytona
 *     adapter doesn't stream (it ignores onStdout/onStderr).
 *   - {@link StepRunner.runDetached}: starts the step in the background (computesdk's `background:true`,
 *     double-fork daemonized so it detaches even on e2b's envd) writing its output to a log file and
 *     its exit code to a done-file, then polls until the done-file appears — via the sandbox filesystem
 *     when one is exposed, else by `cat`-ing the done-file over `exec`. The poll interval backs off
 *     adaptively so a short step isn't over-charged for polling. This survives the 408-prone exec
 *     round-trip, so multi-minute benchmarks complete on every provider.
 *
 * {@link StepRunner.step} reads the provider's declared {@link ProviderTransport} (via
 * {@link selectTransport}) and dispatches: a step that could outlast the provider's synchronous cap
 * runs detached where the provider supports it; everything else runs synchronously. So Daytona keeps
 * its detached+poll path while an uncapped provider (e.g. Modal) runs the same step directly — the
 * harness adapts to the capability rather than hardcoding one provider's transport.
