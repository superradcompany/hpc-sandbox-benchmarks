 * selector ({@link StepRunner.step}) that picks between them per provider instead of hardcoding one
 * provider's quirks:
 *
 *   - {@link StepRunner.run}: a direct synchronous exec. Fine for short steps, but NOT durable for
 *     long ones on a capped provider: Daytona's synchronous executeCommand returns HTTP 408 on
 *     multi-minute commands while the process keeps running server-side, and computesdk's Daytona
 *     adapter doesn't stream (it ignores onStdout/onStderr).
 *   - {@link StepRunner.runDetached}: starts the step in the background (computesdk's `background:true`,
 *     double-fork daemonized so it detaches even on e2b's envd) writing its output to a log file and
 *     its exit code to a done-file, then polls until the done-file appears — via the sandbox filesystem
 *     when one is exposed, else by `cat`-ing the done-file over `exec`. The poll interval backs off
 *     adaptively so a short step isn't over-charged for polling. This survives the 408-prone exec
 *     round-trip, so multi-minute benchmarks complete on every provider.
 *
 * {@link StepRunner.step} reads the provider's declared {@link ProviderTransport} (via
 * {@link selectTransport}) and dispatches: a step that could outlast the provider's synchronous cap
 * runs detached where the provider supports it; everything else runs synchronously. So Daytona keeps
 * its detached+poll path while an uncapped provider (e.g. Modal) runs the same step directly — the
 * harness adapts to the capability rather than hardcoding one provider's transport.

	 * which holds the exec open for as long as its direct child lives (probed live), so the direct
	 * child backgrounds the real job via a second nohup and exits at once — the step truly detaches
	 * across providers. Completion is observed through the sandbox filesystem when one is exposed;
	 * otherwise (providers whose adapter has no filesystem API, and the unit-test fakes) it falls back
	 * to reading the done-file with a `cat` exec. The poll interval backs off adaptively
	 * ({@link POLL_START_MS} → ×{@link POLL_BACKOFF}, capped at {@link POLL_CAP_MS}) so a step that
