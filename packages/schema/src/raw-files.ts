/**
 * The raw-file naming contract — the ONE home for how files in a Run's curated raw tree
 * (`data/raw/<runId>/[r<idx>/]<provider>/<suite>/` — the `r<idx>` level is present when one runner
 * drove a replicate fan-out) are named, and how gap markers are shaped. The in-sandbox
 * producer and the harness collector (writers) and the results extractor (the single reader) all
 * route through this module, so a filename's spelling can never drift between them.
 *
 * A suite that produces no result leaves a MARKER saying why, and the marker's suffix carries the
 * outcome: `--skipped.json` (deliberately not run) or `--failed.json` (attempted, errored). Two
 * suffixes rather than a flag inside one file, so the distinction survives every layer that only ever
 * looks at a filename — the collector's "did this suite report anything at all?" guard included.
 *
 * Layout: a Run nests one subdirectory per provider, and under it one subdirectory per suite that ran
 * (the harness pulls each suite's output into `<provider>/<suite>/`). Tagging the tree by suite lets
 * the normalizer attribute every result to the suite that produced it and reject — per suite — any
 * catalogued metric emitted on a Dimension that suite does not declare (the runtime half of the
 * suite↔dimension↔metric contract; see suite-contract.ts). The normalizer still accepts the older
 * un-nested `<provider>/<file>` layout (results directly under the provider dir) for back-compatibility.
 *
 * Parse, don't validate: the filename predicates and the gap-marker/artifact-name readers are arktype
 * Types — `.matching` regex narrowing plus `.pipe` morphs — so a malformed marker or off-contract name
 * can never produce a half-resolved value. A morph either yields a fully-formed result or `type.errors`.
 *
 * This slice covers the PTS result files and gap markers the node-web-tooling path needs. The
 * lifecycle timing files (`<name>_ms.txt`, `<name>-exit-code.txt`) land with the lifecycle path.
