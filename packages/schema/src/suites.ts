/**
 * The benchmark suite registry — the shared contract between the harness (which runs a suite's
 * commands inside a sandbox) and CI matrix planning (which fans suites out into jobs). Kept here in
 * schema, dependency-free, so both consumers import one source of truth and never disagree on the
 * suite list or its per-suite budgets.
 *
 * Each suite also declares the {@link Suite.dimensions} it measures and the catalogued
 * {@link Suite.metrics} it emits — the producer↔catalog half of the contract. `./suite-contract.ts`
 * checks that declaration against the Metric Catalog at schema load, so a suite emitting an
 * uncatalogued or off-dimension metric fails fast at the boundary instead of silently corrupting the
 * comparison once it runs. The `Dimension` import is type-only, so this module stays runtime
 * dependency-free; the catalog coupling lives entirely in the contract checker.
 *
 * A suite's `commands` are mise tasks (e.g. `mise run benchmark:cpu:node`) implemented by the
 * in-sandbox producer under `/.mise/tasks/benchmark/**` + `/lib/bench.sh`. This slice ships a single
 * cpu-node suite; adding the next is one entry here plus its thin task file (see the producer's
 * `bench.sh` helpers), not a reshape of the harness.
