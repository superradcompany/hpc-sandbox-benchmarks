// profiles) for the network suite's iperf composition. Pre-installing the upstream profile caches
// its source tarball in the image, so the iperf-localhost leaf's vendored-subset re-install
// rebuilds offline instead of re-downloading inside every cell's budget (bake↔leaf agreement is
// gated by tooling/repo-checks pts-profile-pins.test.ts). Every mise-managed toolchain pin is
// unchanged from v5 (mise 2026.7.11, node 22.23.1, pnpm 10.34.5, jc 1.25.7). Re-bake all providers
// before the runs that consume v6.
// v7: no toolchain pin changed from v6 — this is a pure LAYER restructure. The apt install and the
// PTS pre-install were each one RUN, producing compressed layers of 624.7 MB and 970.0 MB. Vercel
// Container Registry rejects any compressed layer over 500 MB mid-push with an opaque HTTP 413
// (https://vercel.com/docs/container-registry/limits-and-pricing), so the bake now installs apt in
// TOOLCHAIN_APT_GROUPS-sized layers and PTS one profile group at a time. The image content is
// identical; only its layer boundaries moved. Re-bake all providers before the runs that consume v7.
// v8: no toolchain pin changed from v7 — mise 2026.7.11, node 22.23.1, pnpm 10.34.5, jc 1.25.7, PTS
// 10.8.4 and the same 10 pre-installed profiles. The delta is entirely about the UNPRIVILEGED runtime
// user E2B-compatible providers inject (Runloop runs its whole lane that way), and it is two things:
//   - The image ENV no longer exports PTS_USER_PATH_OVERRIDE, only PTS_TEST_INSTALL_ROOT_PATH. Sharing
//     root's mutable state put an injected user on a 0600 core.pt2so and — because PTS expands its
//     non-daemon ResultsDirectory through HOME regardless of the override — on a results tree
//     lib/bench.sh's composite finder never searched. Dropping the override leaves that user on PTS's
//     own $HOME default while the baked profiles stay shared, which is the only path PTS 10.8.4
//     exposes an override for. Root is unaffected: its daemonized branch pins the baked root anyway.
//   - installed-tests/pts and its parent are now group/other-writable. batch-install created them 0755
//     root inside the profile layers, AFTER 20-pts.sh's blanket chmod, so an unprivileged user could
//     read every baked profile but could neither install a new one nor discard a baked install — the
//     latter is what install_vendored_pts_profile must do to replace a broken upstream runner, and its
//     silent no-op meant the network suite benchmarked the unrepaired iperf profile.
// v7 published WITHOUT PTS_TEST_INSTALL_ROOT_PATH (the ENV postdates that bake), which is why an
// unprivileged run on it reports 0 of 10 installed profiles; the runtime entry points now set it
// themselves, so v7 images keep working, but Runloop's vendored-profile path needs THIS image.
// Numbers stay comparable across v7↔v8: no pin, profile, or build flag changed — only an env var and
// a directory mode. Re-bake all providers before the runs that consume v8.

 * (Runloop especially) inject an unprivileged runtime user. Those two identities need DIFFERENT
 * mutable state and the SAME installed profiles, which is exactly the split below:
 *
 *   - `PTS_TEST_INSTALL_ROOT_PATH` keeps the baked installed tests shared. It is the only path PTS
 *     10.8.4 exposes its own env override for, and without it an unprivileged run falls back to the
 *     config's `~/.phoronix-test-suite/installed-tests/` and reports ZERO installed tests — the
 *     Runloop failure this exists to prevent. The published v7 image predates this ENV, so setting it
 *     at runtime is what makes an already-published image work.
 *   - `PTS_USER_PATH_OVERRIDE` is UNSET for a non-root user rather than pointed anywhere. PTS's own
 *     per-user default is already `$HOME/.phoronix-test-suite`, and it creates that directory itself —
 *     so there is no mkdir here to fail under `set -e` when HOME is unset or unwritable. Pointing an
 *     unprivileged user at the baked root instead is what breaks: root's `core.pt2so` is mode 0600
 *     (the bake's chmod runs before the profile layers rewrite it), and PTS expands its non-daemon
 *     `ResultsDirectory` through HOME regardless of the override — so the shared setting yields
 *     permission errors AND a results tree lib/bench.sh's composite finder never searches.
 *
 * Root keeps the explicit override. It is redundant when PTS reaches its daemonized branch (writable
 * /var/lib + /etc, which forces PTS_USER_PATH to the baked root anyway), and load-bearing when it
 * does not — without it a root sandbox with a read-only /etc silently switches to
 * /root/.phoronix-test-suite and loses every baked profile.
 *
 * Interpolated verbatim by the harness preamble (packages/harness/src/lib/execute.ts) and the
 * generated smoke probe (packages/templates/src/smoke.ts). lib/bench.sh cannot import TS and restates
 * the same decision in multi-line shell; tooling/repo-checks/src/pts-state-alignment.test.ts gates
 * that copy as text, matching the {@link PTS_APT_DEPS} precedent.
