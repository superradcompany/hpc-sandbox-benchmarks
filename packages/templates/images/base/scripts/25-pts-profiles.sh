# Pre-install ONE group of PTS profiles for offline execution, so sandbox wall time goes to
# benchmarks, not setup. The Dockerfile calls this once per entry in ptsInstallGroups
# (packages/templates/src/lib/pins.ts), each in its own RUN, so each group becomes its own layer.
#
# Why per-group: a single PTS layer measured 970.0 MB compressed and Vercel Container Registry
# rejects any compressed layer over 500 MB with an opaque HTTP 413 mid-push. The group boundaries come
# from measured per-profile compressed sizes (see ptsInstallGroups) — git alone is 451.5 MB.
#
# EVERY step for a group must stay inside THIS script, and therefore inside one RUN:
#   - the download cache is staged and pruned here, because a later layer that deletes a cached
#     tarball cannot shrink the earlier layer that added it;
#   - the chmod is scoped to this group's installed tree, because a blanket `chmod -R` in a later
#     layer copies every file it touches into that layer.
# Splitting any of it back out silently re-inflates the image without failing anything.
