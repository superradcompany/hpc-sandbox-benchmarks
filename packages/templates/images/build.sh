# TypeScript source of truth (packages/templates/src/pins.ts) — there is no versions.env. This script
# validates that config (via bun), passes the image/PTS pins to `docker build` as --build-args, and
# generates the mise.toml (tool versions) + e2b.toml from the same source. Single source of build
# logic for local dev and the publish workflow (the workflow stays thin by shelling out here).

# Usage: packages/templates/images/build.sh
# Honors env overrides: REGISTRY, IMAGE_OWNER, BUILD_DATE, BUILD_REF, BUILD_VERSION.
