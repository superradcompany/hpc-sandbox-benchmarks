// `@sandbox-benchmarks/templates/smoke` — the single smoke spec that proves the baked toolchain
// survived a provider's packaging. ONE list of probes drives both checks so they can't drift:
//   - the docker-level check in toolchain-image.yml (via `smokeBashScript()`, run with `bash -lc`)
//   - the in-sandbox check in `bench-smoke` (via `runSmoke()`, driven by a provider's runCommand)
// The probes mirror what 99-manifest.sh bakes into the image; expects are pinned to pins.ts versions,
// so a check fails loudly if the exact toolchain didn't make it through e2b's envd injection,
// daytona's snapshot, or modal's fromRegistry.
