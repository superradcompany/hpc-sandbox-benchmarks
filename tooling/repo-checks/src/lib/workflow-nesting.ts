/**
 * Invariant 3b (the consolidation invariant): a dispatch lane owns no benchmark cell of its own — it
 * reaches sandboxes only through the reusable bench-suite.yml.
 *
 * bench-smoke.yml used to carry a hand-mirrored copy of the cell: its own checkout, its own Namespace
 * mint, its own per-provider credential block, its own timeout and its own upload. Keeping that copy
 * honest took a cross-lane credential gate (Invariant 4) and still let everything the gate did not
 * compare — the runner routing, the cell budget, the shard-gated upload, the replicate fan-out — drift
 * silently, so a smoke run could pass while exercising a different pipeline than the one it was meant
 * to rehearse. Now both lanes call the reusable, and this rejects the ways back in.
 *
 * THREE probes, because one is not enough. Matching {@link RUN_STEP} by name alone catches the literal
 * copy-paste and nothing else: a re-grown cell under a fresh step name, or provider credentials hung
 * off a job-level `env:`, would both sail through — and those are the shapes someone re-adding a cell
 * by hand actually writes. So also reject a `run:` that invokes the cell driver, and any provider
 * credential appearing anywhere in a lane's env at all. `credentialKeys` is passed in (rather than
 * imported) to keep this module free of the schema dependency; runCheck hands it the registry's
 * requiredEnvVars, so the probe widens automatically when a provider is added.
