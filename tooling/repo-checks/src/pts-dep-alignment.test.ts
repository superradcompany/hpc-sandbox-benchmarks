// Drift gate: the PTS build/runtime apt dependencies are needed in THREE places — the toolchain
// bake (packages/templates/images/base/scripts/00-apt.sh), the stock-image fallback (lib/bench.sh
// ensure_pts), and the per-run refresh (packages/harness setup.ts). Comment-only alignment drifted
// twice for real: fast-cli's Chrome libs were missing from the runtime refresh (run 29587815350 —
// zero fast-cli metrics on modal), and pkg-config was missing everywhere, so PostgreSQL 17's ICU
// discovery failed and every image since #144 shipped pgbench as a launcher-only half-install with
// zero metrics ever recorded.
//
// The runtime refresh now interpolates the canonical PTS_APT_DEPS from the schema toolchain
// contract, so its alignment holds by construction (a wiring tripwire below keeps it honest). The
// two shell consumers cannot import TS, so like the profile-pins gate they are read as text and
// flattened — line-anchored extraction, deliberately not shell parsing.
//
// SUBSET assertion, deliberately not equality: the lists legitimately differ (ensure_pts omits the
// fonts/GTK block, and 00-apt.sh alone carries image plumbing like curl/ca-certificates). What
// must never drift is the core PTS build-dep set below — the packages the source-built profiles
// need at compile time plus PTS's own php runtime.
