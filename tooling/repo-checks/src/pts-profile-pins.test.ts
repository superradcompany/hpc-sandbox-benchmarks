// Drift gate: every VERSION-PINNED PTS profile the repo names must have its definitions vendored
// under packages/schema/src/pts-profiles/ — "the vendored file IS the version pin"
// (packages/schema/scripts/fetch-profiles.ts). The pin is spelled in several places that only
// comments keep aligned: the producer leaves' `run_pts_benchmark "pts/<name>-<ver>"` calls (plus
// run_fio_pts in lib/bench.sh), and the toolchain bake's ptsInstallTests (packages/templates
// pins.ts, which 20-pts.sh also derives its download-cache list from). A version bump that misses a
// copy is silent in CI and expensive live: the sandbox batch-installs a profile the image didn't
// bake (pgbench = a full postgres source build per cell), or runs a profile version whose option
// matrix the catalog never vendored — every result quietly lands as `uncatalogued`.
//
// Like the workflow-sync gate, this reads the files as text: the bash tasks aren't importable, and
// parsing pins.ts as a module would drag a workspace dependency into repo-checks for one string.
