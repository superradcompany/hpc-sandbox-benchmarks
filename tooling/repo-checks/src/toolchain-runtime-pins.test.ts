// Drift gate: the runtime toolchain versions exist in TWO places — the bake pins
// (packages/templates/src/lib/pins.ts, rendered into the image's mise.toml) and the harness's
// stock-image fallback constants (packages/harness/src/lib/setup.ts). Comment-only alignment, and it
// drifted for real: #243 refreshed the pins (node 22.22.3 → 22.23.1, pnpm 10.34.3 → 10.34.5, mise
// 2026.5.16 → 2026.7.11) and left setup.ts behind for two weeks.
//
// Why that is worse than a cosmetic mismatch: every check in setup.ts is EXACT, so a stale constant
// makes the baked toolchain MISS on every provider and every sandbox. The fallback then downloads the
// stale node and rewrites the image's own /etc/mise/config.toml to point at it, and the four
// setupNode suites measure a runtime-fetched toolchain rather than the pinned one — silently,
// wherever the sandbox user is root. Where it is not (runloop), the write is denied and the step
// dies, which is how a repo-wide measurement bug surfaced as one provider looking flaky.
//
// The harness deliberately does NOT import the templates package (it stays decoupled from the bake),
// so the coupling cannot hold by construction the way PTS_APT_DEPS does — this gate is the
// replacement for that. Both sides are read as TEXT and extracted line-anchored, following
// pts-profile-pins: parsing pins.ts as a module would drag a workspace dependency into repo-checks
// for a handful of strings.
